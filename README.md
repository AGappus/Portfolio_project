# Portfolio_project description
Hello. Here is Hi. I am a newbie. This is where I keep my small projects I've created recently.
## The first project
It was written by SQL language. I would like to query some information related to the covid-19 pandemic such as deaths rate, vaccination rate by country, 
continent, worldwide and so on.
## The second project 
The second project I conducted predicting employee attrition in the company. This program predicts employee attrition through Logistics Regression model. It is 
advantageous for company to know what factors leads a employee towards the decision to leave the company or not. From predicted model, the company can gain insights
and have immersive understanding to build strategy, develop retention programs to improving employee satisfaction and keep as many employees as possible.
I coded in Jupyter notebook and visualize with Tableau.
